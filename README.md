This project is a simple Traffic Light Controller designed for physics or electronics students to demonstrate how real-world traffic signals work. Using basic components like LEDs, resistors, a breadboard, and optionally an Arduino or 555 timer, the system cycles through red, yellow, and green lights with timed delays. It helps learners understand key concepts such as electric circuits, Ohmâ€™s Law, LED operation, and timing control. Ideal for school exhibitions or science fairs, this beginner-friendly project offers a hands-on way to explore automation and traffic management systems.
